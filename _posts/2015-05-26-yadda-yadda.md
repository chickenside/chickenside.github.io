<p class="sceneheader">INT. GYM - DAY</p>
<p class="action">Three mooks are exercising.  An AVERAGE MOOK  is on the treadmill.  A GIRL MOOK (small chest protuberance, female voice)  is swinging away at a punching bag.   A FAT MOOK is clad in leg warmers and headband.  He is working out with tiny pink weights while doing aerobics.</p>
<p class="action">A large VIEW-SCREEN plays a WWII documentary showing images of Nazis.</p>
<p class="character">FAT MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Boy, those guys had style.</p>
<p class="character">GIRL MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Look at those uniforms!  Now that's intimidating.</p>
<p class="character">AVERAGE MOOK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(off his costume)</p>
<p class="dialogue">I spend so much time on this.</p>
<p class="character">FAT MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">The teeth are scary, but the <i>Dickies</i>? I’m way scarier without this condom on my head.</p>
<p class="action">The VIEW-SCREEN comes alive with the image of KRA-GOR at the controls of a massive DEATH RAY device.</p>
<p class="character">KRA-GOR (VIEW-SCREEN)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Can one of you guys please explain to me why there are three buttons to fire this thing and just one to self destruct?  Does that make any sense?</p>
<p class="character">FAT MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh that.  Yeah, we ran out of buttons.</p>
<p class="character">KRA-GOR (VIEW-SCREEN)</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(fading)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Seems like if I've already made up my mind to use a death ray, I shouldn't need to press three buttons in sequence then confirm with a voice ident, a retinal scan and a captcha dialog to prove I'm not an Internet bot.  I mean should this thing be connected to the Internet anyway?</p>
<p class="character">AVERAGE MOOK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(over Kra-Gor)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Better lets hit the showers, fellas.  He's in one of those moods, and we have a staff meeting in thirty minutes.</p>

<p class="character">BUNNY MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">They've got flashlights and magnifying glasses and everything.  They're gonna find all our clues!</p>

<p class="dialogue">Where's the rest of the horde?</p>
<p class="action">The Bunny Mook begins to sob and runs off.</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(to Average mook)</p>
<p class="dialogue">We really need some consistency in our uniforms.</p>
<p class="action">The Fat Mook speaks into an intercom on the wall.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Attention dumbass.  Sub-section Scorpio  is completely hosed.  And there ain't any more mooks.  Flappypants and the magic Sleespots killed them all last week, remember?  Oh shit!  A whale!</p>

<p class="character">AVERAGE MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Better let's get to the lab and make more mooks.</p>
<p class="sceneheader">INT. LAB - DAY</p>
<p class="action">The three mooks enter the lab to find the MOOK DISPENSING MACHINE with an OUT OF ORDER sign taped to it.  A VIEW-SCREEN shows Nar Whalberg and the Clue-Saders sneaking through the complex.</p>
<p class="character">FAT MOOK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(off sign)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Ah, pantie puddin'!</p>
<p class="action">Girl Mook rips the sign off the dispenser and opens a panel revealing wires, tubes and a tiny Clint Howard.</p>
<p class="character">TINY CLINT HOWARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">I'm Ron Howard's brother.  I'm lost and scared.</p>
<p class="character">GIRL MOOK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(sweetly)</p>
<p class="dialogue">That’s okay. We’re just glad you aren’t another Carol Burnett leftover. We’ll protect you.</p>
<p class="action">The view-screen SPLITS to include the image of Dr. KRA-GOR struggling with an elaborate HELMET arrayed with tubes, wires and gizmos.</p>

<p class="dialogue">Are you seeing this?</p>
<p class="character">AVERAGE MOOK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(off the Clue-Saders)</p>

<p class="dialogue">There's no chin-strap.  This thing must weigh fifty pounds and there's no chin-strap?</p>
<p class="character">AVERAGE MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Oh that.  That's really more of a prototype.</p>
<p class="character">KRA-GOR (VIEW-SCREEN)</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(fading)</p>
<p class="dialogue">What kind of neck did you envision I have?  Do I look like Amanda Bynes?  One quick turn to the console and <u>snap</u>!  Someone really dropped the ball here.  I swear to god I'm going to bring in OSHA.</p>
<p class="action">Girl Mook continues her repairs while Dr. Kra-Gor drones on.</p>
<p class="character">GIRL MOOK</p>
<p class="parenthetical">(over KRA-GOR)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nice job, tiny Clint.  Now, do you see any spare fuses in there?</p>
<p class="character">TINY CLINT HOWARD</p>
<p class="dialogue">Nope.</p>
<p class="character">GIRL MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Here, use this.</p>
<p class="action">Girl Mook hands him a bullet.  Clint inserts it into the fuse holder and instantly vaporizes as power surges through it.  The Mook Dispenser springs to life.</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(to Girl Mook)</p>
<p class="dialogue">You're a star dancer.  We're in business.</p>
<p class="sceneheader">INT. HALL - DAY</p>
<p class="action">The mooks roll the dispenser into the hall and activate it as the Clue-Saders approach.  Mooks begin streaming out.</p>
<p class="action">The new mooks charge the Clue-Saders.  When they come face-to-face, we see that the new mooks are only nine inches tall.  The new mooks realize their misfortune and retreat.  The Clue-Saders pursue.</p>

<p class="parenthetical">(to Girl Mook)</p>
<p class="dialogue">Do you two even know what you’re <u>doing over there</u>?</p>
<p class="character">AVERAGE MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">They look like part of a complete breakfast!</p>
<p class="character">GIRL MOOK</p>
<p class="dialogue">Shoot their eyes out!</p>
<p class="action">Girl Mook increases the dispensing rate as Fat Mook aims the dispensing tube to release a steady stream of tiny mooks at the Clue-Saders.  This slows their approach a bit.</p>
